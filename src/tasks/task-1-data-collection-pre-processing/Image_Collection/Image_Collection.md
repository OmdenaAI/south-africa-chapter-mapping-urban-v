# Image Collection

## THE PROJECT GOALS

The AI solution should identify key characteristics of urban vulnerability and generate data layers on them from city-level data.

- open data sources

- extraction of data from imageries, and/or complementary sources.

The analysis could involve the creation of surface maps for each form of vulnerability and aggregating the layers to generate a composite ‘city vulnerability layer’. For useful results, the resolution of the data must be good to enable precise identification of vulnerable locations within the city fabric. Identification of locations with multiple vulnerabilities may guide decision-makers on deteriorating locations, especially when monitoring is done at a consistent temporal scale.

### Image Sources

We started the project with a great selection of images from the chapter lead.  
These were checked, duplicates removed sorted into four folders.  

1. DisasterImages
2. Non_Disaster
3. Crime_Images
4. Non_crime_images

We then created some scripts and scraped Google images for more imagery. These in turn were added to the folders.

## Image Preprocessing

Images were resized to 300x300.
